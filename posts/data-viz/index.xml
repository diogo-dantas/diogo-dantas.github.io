The purpose of the application is to enable users to view tweets classified according to the type of sentiment - positive, negative or neutral - in order to analyze public perceptions in real time.

For a fictitious chain of stores, I created a Power BI dashboard with the aim of providing a clear and dynamic view of this data, helping to make more strategic decisions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main task was to transform raw sales and returns data into valuable, strategic information. To do this, I used Power Query in the ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) process from files in XLSX format. This work included detailed cleaning and normalization of the data, structuring it efficiently for analysis.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
