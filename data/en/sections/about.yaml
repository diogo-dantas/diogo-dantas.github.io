# a summary about you
summary: "With more than 11 years of experience in HR and finance, I developed solid skills in data analysis and analytical reporting, which were fundamental to optimizing processes and reducing costs.<br>
This background inspired me to deepen my knowledge of data engineering through courses and hands-on projects that allowed me to explore advanced data manipulation and transformation techniques.<br>
I'm excited about the opportunity to apply this expertise in a data engineering role, where I can help create efficient solutions and drive data-driven decision making<br>."
