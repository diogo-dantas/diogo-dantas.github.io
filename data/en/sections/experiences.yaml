    responsibilities:
    - I structured unstructured databases for financial analysis, with SQL queries (for data cleaning and cross-referencing) and extractions via SAP HANA Web IDE, ensuring accuracy and strategic insights.
    - I automated the extraction and cross-referencing of employee/employee data via SQL, identifying opportunities to reduce charter transport costs. I used queries between tables to propose reallocation of shifts, resulting in 30% fewer trips/day.
    - I critically analyzed vehicle occupancy data, relating information on routes, shifts and costs to suggest optimizations in line with operations.
    - I documented and presented savings proposals through reports, Business Cases in Excel and PowerPoint presentations, ensuring buy-in from the operational team.
    - Extracted restaurant access and meal volume data via SQL (Graphical User Interface), creating scripts to consolidate occupancy and cost KPIs, which enabled the reduction of 2 restaurants.
    - I developed dashboards in Excel and Power Bi to monitor fixed/variable food and transportation costs, with alerts for deviations (e.g. rest of intake above 2%), generating precision in planning and annual budget savings.
    - I critically analyzed employee flow data x menu information, identifying volumes and presenting data to the Purchasing sector to renegotiate incidents and contract savings.
