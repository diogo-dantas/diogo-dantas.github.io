In a highly competitive sector such as electronics, efficient analysis of sales and returns data is essential for improving processes and boosting store performance. For a fictitious chain of stores, I created a Power BI dashboard with the aim of providing a clear and dynamic view of this data, helping to make more strategic decisions.

The main task was to transform raw sales and returns data into valuable, strategic information. To do this, I used Power Query in the ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) process from files in XLSX format. This work included detailed cleaning and normalization of the data, structuring it efficiently for analysis.

The dashboard was divided into three main scenarios: the first presents overall performance, showing turnover, profit and sales data in an interactive way. The second focuses on performance by product and brand, allowing filters by period and geographical location. The third scenario looks at returns, making it easier to identify patterns and optimize internal processes. Each scenario has been designed to be intuitive and provide essential insights for the sales and management teams.

As a result, the company now has a robust tool to monitor its performance and identify areas for improvement. The automation of data updating ensures that information is always up to date and ready for analysis, making it more agile to use.

The video below, in Portuguese, shows the dashboard implemented.
